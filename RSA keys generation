RSA key generation formula 

coprime: does not share any factor with

1- two large prime numbers 
ex: p = 2, q = 7
N = p * q = 14

2- phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1) = 6

3- e for encryption should satisfy those two rules
	- 1 < e < phi(N)
	- coprime with N, phi(N)
e= 5

4- d for decryption should satisfy:
	de(mod phi(N)) = 1
d = 11


key 1: (5, 14)
key 2 : (11, 14)
